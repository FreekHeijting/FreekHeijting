# Hi there 👋

## 🔧 Mechanical Engineer | Automation Engineer | Software Developer | Open Source Advocate

Mechanical Engineering graduate (BSc) with a minor in Mechatronics. Passionate about control systems, automation, and machine design — now building custom software solutions for the construction industry.

Also an Automation Engineer and Electrical Engineer — not formally trained, but built from hands-on experience and solid foundational knowledge.

---

## Background

Started in agricultural machinery, engineering complete systems — from control panels and I/O hardware to hydraulics and pneumatics. Hands-on experience with industrial networks (ASI-3, EtherCAT) and full system integration.

Also worked in construction preparation — the practical side where designs meet reality. Materials, logistics, planning: making sure everything lines up so things actually get built.

Now I've transitioned from mechanical engineering into the AEC industry, applying the same systematic thinking to construction technology and open BIM.

## Current Focus

- 🏗️ Open BIM development with IFC data structures
- 🤖 AI-powered workflows using Claude Code, MCP integrations, and agent architectures
- ⚙️ Custom software solutions for construction and industrial automation
- 📉 Building tools that eliminate inefficiencies and hidden costs

Currently focused on AEC, but the vision extends beyond — other industries and potentially institutions will follow.

## Philosophy

**Libertarian at heart.** I believe in individual freedom, voluntary exchange, and minimal intervention. Open source embodies these principles — decentralized innovation without gatekeepers.

The era of hoarding knowledge behind intellectual property is ending. I share what I build because progress should be accessible to everyone.

---

## Drive

Always chasing the cutting edge. I want to make a real impact on the world — not just build things, but change how industries operate.

---

## On Leadership

Building a company where I'd want to work myself. I've experienced what it's like when young creative minds get shut down instead of supported — and I refuse to repeat that pattern.

I value giving people space to create and take ownership. But leadership also means steering when things go off track. The goal: **freedom with accountability**.

---

## Mindset

Pragmatic and concrete when it's time to act. But I also enjoy deep thinking and philosophical exploration. When I can't figure something out, I'm comfortable wearing an agnostic lens — sometimes *"I don't know"* is the most honest answer.

Open to being convinced. I enjoy genuine dialogue and changing my mind when someone makes a better argument. I hope to stay true to this approach — always.

Creative thinker. Entrepreneur. Always learning from those who know more.
